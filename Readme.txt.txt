- FlowDetermNFkappaB_targetGene_threefeedbacks_A20_NS is the flow in the ODE mathematical model of the NFkappaB system. 

- VectorParamModelNS_derivingfroma contains the parameters from clone R, constrained by transcriptomic data. 

- GetPAramsBfromR_NS generates parameters from clone B, based on those of clone R and transcriptomic data. 

- TrajNFkappaB_threefeedbackNS_A20_targetclassic_vparam_RvsB performs a simulation on clone B and clone R for the parameters chosen and these constraints.
